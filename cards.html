                            Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and later acquired by Oracle. It is designed to be platform-independent, meaning a Java program can run on any system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), following the principle of “Write Once, Run Anywhere.” Java is known for its simplicity, security, robustness, and support for multithreading, which makes it suitable for building large-scale and reliable applications. It is widely used in web applications, mobile applications (especially Android), enterprise software, and backend systems.

                            Python is a high-level, interpreted, and object-oriented programming language created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. It is known for its simple and readable syntax, which makes it easy to learn and use. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. It is widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, and scripting. Python’s extensive standard library and large community support make it a powerful and versatile language for beginners as well as professionals.

                            Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on Google Chrome’s V8 engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server side to build fast and scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it efficient for handling multiple client requests simultaneously. It is widely used for building backend services, APIs, real-time applications, and microservices. With the help of npm (Node Package Manager), Node.js provides access to a vast ecosystem of libraries and tools that speed up development.

                            C is a high-level, procedural programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s at Bell Labs. It is known for its efficiency, speed, and close interaction with hardware, making it suitable for system-level programming such as operating systems, embedded systems, and device drivers. C provides low-level memory access using pointers and has a simple set of keywords, which gives programmers more control over system resources.

                            C++ is an extension of the C programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s. It supports both procedural and object-oriented programming concepts, including classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism. C++ is widely used for developing high-performance applications such as game engines, real-time systems, desktop applications, and software requiring efficient memory management.
